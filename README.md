# snm-fake-music
SnM Sound and Music Engine, as used in the fake.music project

I am releasing a number of albums on bandcamp.com.

  see: fakemusic2020.bandcamp.com

Currently I have released:

  1.source
 
  2.the.event
  
  3.harmony

  4.nature

As each album is released, I am uploading the complete ruby source-code here,
as well as a tutorial that covers the functionality being illustrated in the album.

The source code includes the entire SnM Sound and Music Engine, plus
the actual script used to create the album, and any extra load-files.

Occasionally, I will include the logfiles from the album production lines.
  (Contains specs for all the sounds).
