# snm-fake-music
SnM Sound and Music Engine, as used in the fake.music project

In the first half of 2021, I released a number of albums on bandcamp.com.

  see: fakemusic2020.bandcamp.com

The complete set of released albums is:

  1.source
 
  2.the.event
  
  3.harmony

  4.nature

  5.euclid
  
  
As each album was released, I uploaded the complete ruby source-code here,
as well as a tutorial that covers the functionality being illustrated in the album.

The source code includes the entire SnM Sound and Music Engine, plus
the actual script used to create the album, and any extra load-files.
